### Specific Games
My tools that works only to a specified game. (unfortally)

Please note, all tools here is a modded version of the engine using my StringReloads tool to inject the translation,  
If you have any problem, before report try download the lastest version of the SRL in this git: https://github.com/marcussacana/StringReloads

## Before publish!
Please learn how to use the SRL, I saw groups releasing games without a proper 'user-end' build of patch,  
You don't neeed share .lst, don't need of the StringReloads directory and don't need that console window to be shown!
